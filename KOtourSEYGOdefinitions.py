Definitions needed to generate KO tournaments starting list.
Documentation is embedded along the definitions.

Examples of Test-Runs are comented immediately after each definition.

Run:
python KOtourSEYGOTdefinitions.py
python3 KOtourSEYGOTdefinitions.py

It works in Python 2.7.13 and in Python 3.5.3, but, since there are no special needs, it should run on other versions, also.
